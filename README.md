## Touchdown !

Hi, I’m @jjtops.  I am a Freshman at UMD studying CS+ML.
  I’m interested in Computer Science but more specifically in ML/CV.
  Currently, I am working on more complex CV problems, in addition to Videos(CNN+RNN) implementations.
  I am finding ways to implelment CV in various problems with Health, Engineering and in Sports Analytics. 
  In addition ways CV/ML can help preserve our planet.
