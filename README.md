## Touchdown !

Hi, I’m @jjtops.  I am a junior at Edison High.
  I’m interested in Computer Science but more specifically in ML/AI.
  I’m currently learning some of the advanced neural networks such as CNN and RNN in-depth. 
  I’m looking to collaborate on any ideas you may have that I would be open to. 
  I get excited while applying ML/AI to various sports such as football, basketball, cricket, etc. 
  I am also trying to find ways to use Ml/AI to help preserve our planet.
