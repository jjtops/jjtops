-  Hi, I’m @jjtops
-  I’m interested in ML/AI. 
-  I’m currently learning some of the more indepth neural networks such as CNN and RNN. 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on any ideas you may have that I would be open to. 
-  I have a big interest in using ML/AI in various sports such as football, basketball, cricket, etc. 
-  I am also trying to find ways to use Ml/AI to help preserve our planet.
