## Touchdown !

Hi, I’m @jjtops.  I am a junior at Edison High.
  I’m interested in Computer Science but more specifically in ML/AI.
  Currently I am learning some of the advanced neural networks, in-depth, such as CNN and RNN.
  I get excited while applying ML/AI to various sports such as football, basketball, cricket, etc. 
  I am also trying to find ways to use Ml/AI to help preserve our planet.
